  This is a quick-and-dirty proof-of-concept of serializing Lua 5.1
functions using CBOR.  The issue here is not only obtaining the bytecode
(via string.dump()) but also serializing the upvalues and environment (the
"global" space if it where) of the function.

  This is not meant for production.  This is for experimental purposes only.

  You have been warned.
